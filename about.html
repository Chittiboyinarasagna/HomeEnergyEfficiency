                    <h3>4.LED Lighting </h3>
                    <p><strong>Energy-efficient LED bulbs to highlight sustainable energy consumption.</strong>Switching
                        to LED (Light Emitting Diode) lighting is one of the simplest and most effective ways to improve
                        energy efficiency at home. LED lights consume up to 80% less energy than traditional
                        incandescent bulbs while lasting significantly longer.<br>
                        <b>Energy Efficiency</b> – Uses less electricity and produces more light per watt.<br>
                        <b>Longer Lifespan</b> – Lasts 25,000 to 50,000 hours, compared to 1,000 hours for incandescent
                        bulbs.<br>
                        <b>Lower Heat Emission</b> – Generates very little heat, reducing cooling costs.<br>
                        <b>Eco-Friendly</b> – Contains no toxic chemicals like mercury (found in CFL bulbs).<br>
                        <b>Cost-Effective</b> – Though slightly more expensive upfront, LEDs save money in the long run
                        on
                        energy bills and replacements.

                    <h3>5.Smart Thermostat </h3>
                    <p><strong>A smart home thermostat for temperature regulation and energy saving.</strong>A smart
                        thermostat is an advanced temperature control device that optimizes heating and cooling in your
                        home. Unlike traditional thermostats, smart thermostats learn your schedule, adjust temperatures
                        automatically, and help reduce energy waste—all while providing convenience through remote
                        control via smartphone apps, voice assistants, or automation.<br>
                        <b> Remote Control</b> – Adjust temperature from anywhere via a mobile app.<br>
                        <b> Learning Algorithms</b> – Automatically sets efficient temperatures based on your
                        habits.<br>
                        <b> Energy Monitoring</b> – Tracks usage and provides reports on cost savings.<br>
                        <b> Voice Control</b> – Works with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri.<br>
                        <b> Geofencing</b> – Detects when you leave or return home and adjusts settings accordingly.<br>
                        <b> Integration with Smart Home Devices</b> – Syncs with lights, fans, and HVAC systems for
                        total
                        automation.<br>

                    <h3>6.Eco-Friendly Appliances</h3>
                    <p><strong>A kitchen with energy-efficient appliances (like an ENERGY STAR
                            fridge)</strong>Eco-friendly appliances are designed to consume less energy, water, and
                        natural resources, making them a sustainable and cost-effective choice for your home. Investing
                        in energy-efficient appliances reduces electricity bills, lowers carbon emissions, and minimizes
                        environmental impact.<br>
                        <b>Lower Energy Consumption</b> – Uses up to 50% less electricity than traditional
                        appliances.<br>
                        <b>Water Conservation</b> – Reduces water waste through efficient usage.<br>
                        <b> Cost Savings</b> – Decreases utility bills over time.<br>
                        <b>Reduced Carbon Footprint</b> – Less energy use means fewer greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
                        <b>Longer Lifespan</b> – Built to last, reducing waste in landfills.<br>
                        <b>Healthier Home</b> – Many eco-friendly appliances use non-toxic materials.
